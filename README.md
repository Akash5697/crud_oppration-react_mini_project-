🚀 How It Works?



This project follows the CRUD pattern:

Create (C)
The user enters data in the input fields.
The handelSave() function adds the new employee object to the data state.

Read (R)
The application initially loads employee data from Employeedata in useEffect().
The employee list is displayed dynamically using .map().

Update (U)
Clicking "Edit" populates the input fields with the selected employee's data.
handelUpdate() modifies the existing employee record.
Delete (D)

Clicking "Delete" removes an employee from the list using handelDelete().
It filters the state to remove the selected employee.
